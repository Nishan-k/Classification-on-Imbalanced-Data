# Classification on Imbalanced Data
 This repository is dedicated to exploring various techniques and methodologies for dealing with imbalanced datasets in classification tasks. Imbalanced data is a common challenge in machine learning, where certain classes are underrepresented compared to others. This imbalance can lead to biased models that perform poorly on minority classes.

In real-world, when performing classification, the situation of having a imbalanced class is a very common situation. If we don't handle it and build the models to train on it, there will be bias and we will not be able to get an accurate and reliable outcome. So, these datasets must be handled and then only used to train the model.
